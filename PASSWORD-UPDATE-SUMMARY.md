# Password Security Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Password Validation Rules ✅

**File:** `lib/validation.js`

**Updated Requirements:**
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters
- ✅ At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
- ✅ At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
- ✅ At least 1 number (0-9)
- ✅ At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};"':|,.<>/?)

**New Error Message:**
```
"Password must contain at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character"
```

### 2. Updated Account Passwords ✅

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@rv.com`
- Old Password: ~~`admin123`~~ ❌ (didn't meet requirements)
- **New Password: `Admin123!`** ✅

**Test User Account:**
- Email: `joe@test.com`
- Old Password: ~~`test123`~~ ❌ (didn't meet requirements)
- **New Password: `Test123!`** ✅

### 3. Updated Seed Script ✅

**File:** `scripts/seed-supabase.js`

Now uses strong passwords that meet all requirements when creating new accounts.

### 4. Created Password Update Script ✅

**File:** `scripts/update-passwords.js`

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run update-passwords
```

This script:
- Updates existing account passwords in Supabase
- Works for both local development and production
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

### 5. Frontend Validation (Already in Place) ✅

**Files:**
- `app/components/AccountCreationForm.js`
- `app/reset-password/page.js`

Both forms already include:
- Real-time password validation
- Visual indicators for each requirement
- User-friendly error messages
- Password strength feedback

## Testing

### Local Development

1. **Test Login with New Credentials:**
   ```
   Admin: admin@rv.com / Admin123!
   Test User: joe@test.com / Test123!
   ```

2. **Test Password Creation:**
   - Try creating an account with a weak password → Should show requirements
   - Create account with strong password → Should succeed

3. **Test Password Reset:**
   - Request password reset
   - Try weak password → Should fail with requirements
   - Use strong password → Should succeed

### Production Deployment

After deploying to production:

1. Run the password update script:
   ```bash
   npm run update-passwords
   ```

2. Verify all users can log in with their new passwords

3. Test new account creation enforces password requirements

## Security Benefits

✅ **Stronger passwords** resistant to brute force attacks
✅ **Special character requirement** increases password complexity
✅ **Consistent enforcement** across all password entry points

✅ **Automated updates** for existing accounts

## Migration Notes
