# User Deletion Issue - Fixed

## Problem
When deleting users from the admin panel, users were being removed from the Supabase database table but **not** from Supabase Auth. This meant:
- Users disappeared from the admin dashboard
- Users could still log in with their credentials
- Users still appeared in the Supabase Auth dashboard

## Root Cause
The deletion API (`/api/admin/accounts`) was catching auth deletion errors silently and continuing execution without reporting failures. The code would:
1. Successfully delete users from the database
2. Try to delete from Supabase Auth
3. If auth deletion failed, log to console but still return `success: true`
4. Users would see "success" but auth users remained

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Improved Error Handling in API (`app/api/admin/accounts/route.js`)
- Now properly captures auth deletion errors
- Tracks which specific users failed to delete from auth
- Returns detailed error information including:
  - User IDs that failed
  - Auth IDs that failed
  - Specific error messages
- Returns HTTP 207 (Multi-Status) when database deletion succeeds but auth deletion fails

### 2. Better Error Display in UI (`app/admin/page.js`)
- Shows detailed error messages when auth deletion fails
- Lists each user that couldn't be deleted from auth
- Provides actionable guidance to manually delete from Supabase dashboard

## How to Test

1. Try deleting users from the admin panel
2. If you see an error message like:
   ```
   Deleted X users from database, but failed to delete Y auth users. Check console for details.
   
   Auth deletion failures:
   - User ABC123 (auth_id: def456): [error message]
   ```
   Then your Supabase Service Role Key might not be configured correctly.

3. Check your browser console and server logs for detailed error messages

## Verifying Supabase Configuration

The service role key is required to delete auth users. Verify it's properly set:

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Make sure you have `.env.local` (for local dev) or environment variables set (for production) with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # ⚠️ CRITICAL for auth deletion
```

### 2. Find Your Service Role Key

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
3. Copy the **service_role** key (NOT the anon key)
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

⚠️ **Security Warning**: The service role key bypasses all Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Never expose it to the frontend or commit it to git.

### 3. Restart Your Dev Server

After updating environment variables:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
npm run dev
```

## Manual Cleanup (If Needed)

If you have orphaned auth users (deleted from database but still in auth):

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Users**
3. Find users that shouldn't exist
4. Click the three dots menu and select "Delete user"

## Testing the Fix

1. Seed some test accounts from the admin panel
2. Try deleting all accounts
3. You should either:
   - Get a success message (all users deleted from both database and auth)
   - Get a detailed error message showing which auth users failed to delete

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures you always know when deletion partially fails
- Database cleanup always happens first (to maintain data integrity)
- Auth deletion errors are non-fatal but are now properly reported
- The fix uses HTTP 207 (Multi-Status) to indicate partial success
