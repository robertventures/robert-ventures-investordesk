## üìã About This Platform

Robert Ventures Investment Platform enables investors to purchase bonds with flexible terms:
- **Investment amounts:** $1,000 minimum (increments of $10)
- **Lockup periods:** 1-year (8% APY) or 3-year (10% APY)
- **Payment options:** Monthly payouts or compounding
- **Account types:** Individual, Joint, Entity, or IRA

The platform handles the complete investment lifecycle: user registration, investment creation, admin approval workflow, interest calculations, monthly distributions, and withdrawal processing.

## üéØ Your Mission

Build a **Python FastAPI backend** [[memory:9422626]] that:
1. Mirrors the exact business logic of the existing Next.js implementation
2. Reads from the same data store (Netlify Blobs) [[memory:9329168]]
3. Generates activity events including proration and compounding
4. Respects the admin-controlled app time for calculations
5. Matches calculations to the penny with the reference implementation

2. **Study Investment States & Rules** - Learn the core business logic  
3. **Master Interest Calculations** - Get calculations exactly right
4. **Implement Data Models** - Match the expected JSON structure
5. **Build API Endpoints** - Follow the exact endpoint specifications
6. **Test Thoroughly** - Validate against test scenarios

**Estimated reading time:** 3-4 hours  
**Implementation time:** 2-3 weeks (depending on team size)

---

## üîë Critical Success Factors

### ‚úÖ Exact JSON Structure
Frontend expects precise field names and data types. Do not modify schema.

### ‚úÖ Penny-Perfect Calculations
Interest calculations must match reference implementation exactly. Use provided formulas.

### ‚úÖ App Time System
All date/time logic uses "app time" (not system time) for testing and demos.

### ‚úÖ Sequential IDs
Human-readable IDs like `USR-1001`, `INV-10000`, `WDL-10000` (not UUIDs).

### ‚úÖ State Machine Integrity
Investment states must transition according to defined rules only.

## Overview

This is an investment platform where users invest in bonds with two payment options:
- **Monthly payouts** - Interest paid monthly to bank account
- **Compounding** - Interest compounds monthly, paid at maturity

**Your job:** Implement a Python backend that mirrors these business rules exactly.

---

## Authentication & Verification

### Overview

The platform implements a progressive authentication system that allows users to sign in before completing email verification, but redirects them to complete verification before accessing the platform.

### User Sign-Up Flow

1. **Account Creation**
   - User provides email and password
   - Account created with `isVerified: false`
   - User immediately logged in
   - Redirected to `/confirmation` page

2. **Email Verification**
   - User must enter 6-digit verification code
   - Test code: `000000` (production: send real email)
   - Once verified: `isVerified: true`, `verifiedAt` timestamp set
   - User redirected to investment page

### Sign-In Flow for Unverified Users

**Key Feature:** Unverified users can sign in, but must complete verification before accessing the platform.

```python
def authenticate_user(email, password):
    """
    Authenticate user and determine redirect based on verification status.
    """
    user = get_user_by_email(email)
    
    if not user or not verify_password(password, user.password):
        return {"success": False, "error": "Invalid credentials"}
    
    # Determine redirect based on user status
    if user.is_admin:
        redirect = "/admin"
    elif not user.is_verified:
        redirect = "/confirmation"  # Must verify before accessing platform
    else:
        redirect = "/dashboard"
    
    return {
        "success": True,
        "user": user,
        "redirect": redirect
    }
```

**Business Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Allow sign-in for unverified users
- ‚úÖ Redirect to verification page if not verified
- ‚úÖ Admins bypass verification check
- ‚úÖ Store session immediately (no waiting for verification)
- ‚ùå Don't allow dashboard access until verified

### Password Reset & Email Verification

**Key Innovation:** Password reset serves dual purpose:
1. Allows users to reset forgotten passwords
2. Automatically verifies email (proves email ownership)

#### Password Reset Request

```python
def request_password_reset(email):
    """
    Generate password reset token and store it.
    In production, send email with reset link.
    """
    user = get_user_by_email(email)
    
    # Security: Always return success (prevent email enumeration)
    if not user:
        return {"success": True}
    
    # Generate secure token
    reset_token = generate_secure_token()  # 32-byte random hex
    reset_token_expiry = current_time() + timedelta(hours=1)
    
    # Store token
    update_user(user.id, {
        "resetToken": reset_token,
        "resetTokenExpiry": reset_token_expiry
    })
    
    # In production: send email
    # send_email(user.email, reset_link)
    
    # In development: log token
    print(f"Reset URL: /reset-password?token={reset_token}")
    
    return {"success": True}
```

#### Password Reset Processing

```python
def reset_password(token, new_password):
    """
    Reset password and automatically verify account.
    """
    # Find user by token
    user = find_user_by_reset_token(token)
    
    if not user:
        return {"success": False, "error": "Invalid or expired token"}
    
    # Check expiry
    if user.reset_token_expiry < current_time():
        return {"success": False, "error": "Token expired"}
    
    # Validate password requirements
    if not validate_password(new_password):
        return {"success": False, "error": "Password doesn't meet requirements"}
    
    # Update user
    timestamp = current_time()
    update_user(user.id, {
        "password": hash_password(new_password),
        "isVerified": True,  # Auto-verify (email ownership proven)
        "verifiedAt": user.verified_at or timestamp,
        "resetToken": None,  # Clear token
        "resetTokenExpiry": None,
        "updatedAt": timestamp
    })
    
    return {
        "success": True,
        "message": "Password reset successful. Your account has been verified."
    }
```

**Why This Works:**
- User received email ‚Üí proves email ownership
- No separate verification code needed
- Better UX: one step instead of two
- Industry standard (GitHub, many SaaS platforms)

### Verification Code System

For direct email verification (not password reset):

```python
def verify_account(user_id, verification_code):
    """
    Verify user account with code.
    """
    user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
    
    if not user:
        return {"success": False, "error": "User not found"}
    
    # Check code (in production, validate against stored code)
    if verification_code != "000000":  # Test code
        return {"success": False, "error": "Invalid verification code"}
    
    # Mark as verified
    update_user(user_id, {
        "isVerified": True,
        "verifiedAt": current_time(),
        "verificationCode": None  # Clear code
    })
    
    return {"success": True}
```

### Authentication Endpoints

#### POST `/api/users` (Sign Up)
```json
Request:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "USR-1001",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "isVerified": false
  }
}
```

#### POST `/api/auth/request-reset`
```json
Request:
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "abc123..." // Only in development
}
```

#### POST `/api/auth/reset-password`
```json
Request:
{
  "token": "abc123...",
  "newPassword": "NewSecure123!"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password reset successful. Your account has been verified."
}
```

#### PUT `/api/users/:id` (Verify Account)
```json
Request:
{
  "_action": "verifyAccount",
  "verificationCode": "000000"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "USR-1001",
    "isVerified": true,
    "verifiedAt": "2025-10-05T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations

#### Email Enumeration Prevention
```python
# ‚ùå BAD - Reveals if email exists
if not user:
    return {"success": False, "error": "Email not found"}

# ‚úÖ GOOD - Always returns success
if not user:
    return {"success": True}  # Don't reveal email existence
```

#### Token Management
- **Expiry:** 1 hour for reset tokens
- **One-time use:** Clear token after successful reset
- **Secure generation:** Use `crypto.randomBytes(32)` or equivalent
- **Storage:** Store token hash, not plaintext (optional enhancement)

#### Password Requirements
Must contain:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character

```python
def validate_password(password):
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    if not any(c.isupper() for c in password):
        return False
    if not any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
        return False
    if not any(c in "!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?" for c in password):
        return False
    return True
```

#### Session Timeout & Inactivity

**Security Requirement:** Automatic logout after inactivity to protect user accounts.

**Timeout Duration:** 10 minutes of inactivity

**Implementation Strategy:**

Frontend tracks user activity and automatically logs out inactive users:

```python
# Session Configuration
INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT = 10 * 60  # 10 minutes in seconds

# Activity events that reset the timer:
- Mouse movement
- Keyboard input
- Click events
- Touch events (mobile)
- Scroll events
```

**Frontend Implementation (JavaScript/TypeScript):**

```javascript
class SessionManager {
    constructor(timeoutMinutes = 10) {
        this.timeout = timeoutMinutes * 60 * 1000;  // Convert to milliseconds
        this.warningTime = 1 * 60 * 1000;  // Show warning 1 minute before
        this.lastActivity = Date.now();
        this.timeoutId = null;
        this.warningTimeoutId = null;
        this.initActivityListeners();
        this.startTimer();
    }

    initActivityListeners() {
        // Activity events that reset the timer
        const events = ['mousedown', 'mousemove', 'keypress', 'scroll', 'touchstart', 'click'];
        
        events.forEach(event => {
            document.addEventListener(event, () => this.resetTimer(), { passive: true });
        });
    }

    resetTimer() {
        this.lastActivity = Date.now();
        
        // Clear existing timers
        if (this.timeoutId) clearTimeout(this.timeoutId);
        if (this.warningTimeoutId) clearTimeout(this.warningTimeoutId);
        
        // Set warning timer (1 minute before logout)
        this.warningTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            this.showWarning();
        }, this.timeout - this.warningTime);
        
        // Set logout timer
        this.timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            this.logout();
        }, this.timeout);
    }

    showWarning() {
        // Show modal or notification
        const shouldStay = confirm(
            'Your session will expire in 1 minute due to inactivity. ' +
            'Click OK to stay logged in.'
        );
        
        if (shouldStay) {
            this.resetTimer();
        }
    }

    logout() {
        // Clear local storage
        localStorage.removeItem('currentUserId');
        localStorage.removeItem('signupEmail');
        localStorage.removeItem('currentInvestmentId');
        
        // Redirect to sign-in page
        window.location.href = '/sign-in?timeout=true';
    }

    startTimer() {
        this.resetTimer();
    }

    destroy() {
        if (this.timeoutId) clearTimeout(this.timeoutId);
        if (this.warningTimeoutId) clearTimeout(this.warningTimeoutId);
    }
}

// Initialize session manager on protected pages
if (localStorage.getItem('currentUserId')) {
    const sessionManager = new SessionManager(10);  // 10 minutes
}
```

**Backend Session Validation (Optional Enhancement):**

For additional security, track session creation time on the backend:

```python
def validate_session(user_id, session_token):
    """
    Validate session hasn't expired on server side.
    """
    session = get_session(session_token)
    
    if not session:
        return {"valid": False, "error": "Session not found"}
    
    # Check if session is expired (e.g., 24 hours)
    if is_expired(session.created_at, hours=24):
        delete_session(session_token)
        return {"valid": False, "error": "Session expired"}
    
    # Update last activity timestamp
    session.last_activity = get_current_time()
    save_session(session)
    
    return {"valid": True}
```

**Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Frontend (Required):**
   - Implement activity listener on all authenticated pages
   - Track mouse, keyboard, touch, and scroll events
   - Show warning dialog 1 minute before timeout
   - Automatically logout and redirect to sign-in page
   - Display informative message on sign-in page when redirected due to timeout

2. **Backend (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Store session creation timestamp
   - Implement session expiry check (24 hours max session life)
   - Validate session on critical operations (investments, withdrawals, profile changes)
   - Clean up expired sessions periodically

3. **User Experience:**
   - **Warning Dialog:** "Your session will expire in 1 minute due to inactivity. Click OK to stay logged in."
   - **Timeout Redirect Message:** "Your session has expired due to inactivity. Please sign in again."
   - **Activity Reset:** Any user interaction resets the 10-minute timer
   - **Smooth UX:** Timer reset shouldn't interrupt user actions or cause UI flicker

4. **Security Benefits:**
   - Protects against unauthorized access from unattended devices
   - Reduces risk of session hijacking
   - Enforces security best practices
   - Complies with financial industry security standards

**Testing Scenarios:**

```
Test 1: Inactivity Timeout
1. Sign in to user account
2. Leave browser open without interaction for 10 minutes
3. ‚úì User automatically logged out
4. ‚úì Redirected to /sign-in with timeout message

Test 2: Activity Reset
1. Sign in to user account
2. Wait 8 minutes
3. Click anywhere on page
4. Wait 8 more minutes (16 minutes total)
5. ‚úì User still logged in (timer was reset at 8 minutes)

Test 3: Warning Dialog
1. Sign in to user account
2. Wait 9 minutes without interaction
3. ‚úì Warning dialog appears
4. Click OK on warning
5. ‚úì Timer resets, user stays logged in

Test 4: Multiple Tabs
1. Open two tabs with the same account
2. Be active in Tab A
3. Switch to Tab B after 9 minutes
4. ‚úì Should still be logged in (shared session)
```

**Configuration Options:**

```javascript
// Adjustable timeout values
const SESSION_CONFIG = {
    // Inactivity timeout (10 minutes for production)
    inactivityTimeout: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 30 : 10,  // minutes
    
    // Warning before logout (1 minute)
    warningBeforeTimeout: 1,  // minutes
    
    // Maximum session lifetime (24 hours)
    maxSessionLife: 24,  // hours
    
    // Admin sessions (longer timeout)
    adminInactivityTimeout: 30  // minutes
};
```

### Testing the Flow

**Test Scenario 1: Unverified User Sign-In**
```
1. Create account ‚Üí logged in ‚Üí at /confirmation
2. Close browser (don't verify)
3. Sign in again
4. ‚úì Redirected to /confirmation (not dashboard)
5. Enter code 000000
6. ‚úì Verified, redirected to dashboard
7. Sign in again
8. ‚úì Go directly to dashboard
```

**Test Scenario 2: Password Reset Auto-Verification**
```
1. Create account (don't verify)
2. Sign out
3. Click "Forgot Password?"
4. Enter email
5. Copy reset URL from console
6. Open reset URL
7. Create new password
8. ‚úì Account automatically verified
9. Sign in with new password
10. ‚úì Go directly to dashboard (no verification needed)
```

**Test Scenario 3: Already Verified User**
```
1. Sign in with verified account
2. ‚úì Go directly to dashboard
3. ‚úì Never see confirmation page
```

### Development vs Production

#### Development Mode
- Verification code: `000000` (hardcoded)
- Reset tokens logged to console
- Reset URLs included in API response
- No actual emails sent

#### Production Mode
- Generate random 6-digit verification codes
- Send emails via SendGrid/AWS SES/Resend
- Remove tokens from API responses
- Implement rate limiting (max 5 reset requests per hour)
- Log all authentication attempts

### Database Schema Updates

Add these fields to User model:

```python
class User:
    # Existing fields...
    is_verified: bool = False
    verified_at: datetime = None
    verification_code: str = None
    
    # Password reset fields
    reset_token: str = None
    reset_token_expiry: datetime = None
```

### Integration with Investment Flow

**Key Rule:** Users must be verified before creating investments.

```python
def create_investment(user_id, investment_data):
    user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
    
    if not user.is_verified:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": "Please verify your email before investing"
        }
    
    # Proceed with investment creation...
```

---

## Dual Approval System

### Overview

The platform implements a **dual approval system** for critical financial operations to ensure security and compliance. This system requires two independent approvals before funds move:

1. **Bank Approval** - Confirms funds received/available
2. **Admin Approval** - Manual review and authorization

**Rationale:**
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized or fraudulent transactions
- **Compliance**: Ensures manual oversight of all financial movements
- **Audit Trail**: Clear record of who approved what and when
- **Future Automation**: Bank approval can be automated via banking API integration

### Investment Approval Flow

#### Current Phase: Admin Approval Only (Bank Auto-Approved)

**Phase 1 Implementation (Current):**
When a user submits an investment, it requires **admin approval only** to become active. Bank approval is automatically set to `true` until banking integration is complete.

```
User Submits ‚Üí pending (bank auto-approved ‚úì) ‚Üí Admin Reviews ‚Üí active
```

**Detailed Flow:**

1. **User Submits Investment** (`status: pending`)
   - Investment created with amount, lockup, payment frequency
   - User sends funds to Robert Ventures bank account
   - `bankApproved`: **automatically set to `true`**
   - `bankApprovedBy`: "system"
   - `bankApprovedAt`: submission timestamp
   - Only needs admin approval to activate

2. **Admin Reviews & Approves** (`adminApproved: true`)
   - Admin verifies:
     - User documents complete ‚úì
     - Investment details correct ‚úì
     - No red flags ‚úì
   - Admin approves ‚Üí `adminApproved: true`

3. **Investment Activated** (`status: active`)
   - When admin approves, investment immediately activates (bank already approved)
   - System automatically sets `status: active`
   - `confirmedAt` timestamp set
   - Interest starts accruing next day

**Phase 2 Implementation (Future - Banking Integration):**
When banking API is integrated, the flow changes to true dual approval:

```
User Submits ‚Üí pending ‚Üí Bank API Confirms Receipt ‚Üí pending (bank approved) ‚Üí Admin Reviews ‚Üí active
```

1. **User Submits Investment** (`status: pending`)
   - `bankApproved`: **set to `false`** (waiting for bank confirmation)
   - User sends funds to Robert Ventures bank account

2. **Banking API Webhook** (`bankApproved: true`)
   - Banking API detects incoming transfer
   - System matches transfer to pending investment
   - Auto-marks `bankApproved: true`
   - `bankApprovedBy`: "system"

3. **Admin Reviews & Approves** (`adminApproved: true`)
   - Admin verifies bank approval received
   - Admin manually approves

4. **Investment Activated** (`status: active`)
   - Both approvals complete ‚Üí auto-activates

**Data Model:**

```python
class Investment:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Dual approval fields
    bank_approved: bool = True  # Default TRUE until banking integration complete
    bank_approved_at: datetime = None
    bank_approved_by: str = "system"  # "system" for auto-approval, admin ID for manual
    
    admin_approved: bool = False
    admin_approved_at: datetime = None
    admin_approved_by: str = None  # admin user ID
    
    # Only set when BOTH approvals complete
    confirmed_at: datetime = None
```

**IMPORTANT - Current Phase:**
- `bankApproved` defaults to `True` (auto-approved by system)
- This allows admin-only approval workflow during development
- Infrastructure is in place for future banking API integration
- When banking integration is ready, change default to `False`

**Business Rules:**

```python
def can_activate_investment(investment):
    """
    Investment can only activate when both approvals are complete.
    """
    return investment.bank_approved and investment.admin_approved

def activate_investment_if_ready(investment):
    """
    Auto-activate investment when both approvals are complete.
    """
    if not investment.bank_approved or not investment.admin_approved:
        return False
    
    if investment.status == 'pending':
        investment.status = 'active'
        investment.confirmed_at = current_time()
        
        # Calculate lockup end date
        if investment.lockup_period == '1-year':
            investment.lockup_end_date = investment.confirmed_at + timedelta(days=365)
        else:  # 3-year
            investment.lockup_end_date = investment.confirmed_at + timedelta(days=1095)
        
        # Create confirmation activity event
        create_activity_event(
            user_id=investment.user_id,
            investment_id=investment.id,
            type='investment_confirmed',
            amount=investment.amount,
            date=investment.confirmed_at
        )
        
        return True
    
    return False
```

**API Implementation:**

```python
# POST /api/admin/investments/:id/approve-bank
def approve_bank(investment_id, admin_id):
    """
    Mark investment as bank approved (funds received).
    """
    investment = get_investment(investment_id)
    
    if investment.status != 'pending':
        return {"success": False, "error": "Only pending investments can be bank approved"}
    
    investment.bank_approved = True
    investment.bank_approved_at = current_time()
    investment.bank_approved_by = admin_id  # or "system" for future automation
    
    save_investment(investment)
    
    # Check if ready to activate
    activate_investment_if_ready(investment)
    
    return {"success": True, "investment": investment}


# POST /api/admin/investments/:id/approve-admin
def approve_admin(investment_id, admin_id):
    """
    Admin approves investment after reviewing details.
    """
    investment = get_investment(investment_id)

### Monthly Payout Approval Flow

#### Payout Requires Admin Approval

All monthly payouts (for `monthly` payment frequency investments) require admin approval before being sent to users' bank accounts.

**Flow:**

```
Monthly Event Generated ‚Üí pending_approval ‚Üí Admin Reviews ‚Üí approved ‚Üí Send to Bank ‚Üí completed
```

**Detailed Process:**

1. **System Generates Monthly Payout** (Cron Job)
   - On 1st of each month, system generates payouts
   - Status: `pending_approval`
   - Amount calculated and stored
   - Payout queued for admin review

2. **Admin Reviews Payout Queue**
   - Admin dashboard shows all `pending_approval` payouts
   - Admin verifies:
     - Investment is active ‚úì
     - Bank account connected ‚úì
     - Amount is correct ‚úì
     - No withdrawal in progress ‚úì

3. **Admin Approves Payout**
   - Admin clicks "Approve Payout"
   - Status: `approved`
   - `approvedBy` and `approvedAt` recorded

4. **System Sends to Bank**
   - Automated process sends approved payouts to bank
   - If successful: Status: `completed`
   - If failed: Status: `failed`, queued for retry

**Data Model for Payouts:**

```python
class ActivityEvent:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # For monthly_distribution events only
    payout_status: str = None  # 'pending_approval' | 'approved' | 'completed' | 'failed'
    approved_by: str = None  # admin user ID
    approved_at: datetime = None
    
    # Failure handling
    failure_reason: str = None
    retry_count: int = 0
    
    # Bank details
    payout_bank_id: str = None
    payout_bank_nickname: str = None
```

**Payout Status Flow:**

```python
PAYOUT_STATUS_FLOW = {
    'pending_approval': 'Waiting for admin approval',
    'approved': 'Approved, ready to send',
    'completed': 'Successfully sent to bank',
    'failed': 'Bank transfer failed'
}
```

**Generate Monthly Payouts (Cron Job):**

```python

### Security Considerations

#### Approval Permissions

```python
def require_admin_permission(admin_id, permission):
    """
    Check if admin has specific permission.
    """
    admin = get_user(admin_id)
    
    if not admin.is_admin:
        raise PermissionError("Not an admin")
    
    # Future: role-based permissions
    # if permission not in admin.permissions:
    #     raise PermissionError(f"Missing permission: {permission}")
    
    return True


def can_approve_investments(admin_id):
    return require_admin_permission(admin_id, 'approve_investments')


def can_approve_payouts(admin_id):
    return require_admin_permission(admin_id, 'approve_payouts')
```

#### Audit Trail

Every approval must be logged:

```python
def log_approval_action(action_type, entity_id, admin_id, details):
    """
    Log all approval actions for audit trail.
    """
    log_entry = {
        'timestamp': current_time(),
        'action_type': action_type,  # 'investment_bank_approved', 'investment_admin_approved', 'payout_approved'
        'entity_id': entity_id,
        'admin_id': admin_id,
        'admin_email': get_user(admin_id).email,
        'details': details
    }
    
    save_audit_log(log_entry)
```

#### Approval Validation

```python
def validate_investment_approval(investment, admin_id):
    """
    Validate investment can be approved.
    """
    if investment.status != 'pending':
        raise ValidationError("Investment must be in pending status")
    
    if investment.admin_approved:
        raise ValidationError("Investment already admin approved")
    
    if not investment.bank_approved:
        raise ValidationError("Bank approval required first")
    
    # Additional checks
    user = get_user(investment.user_id)
    if not user.is_verified:
        raise ValidationError("User must verify email before approval")
    
    if not user.bank_accounts:
        raise ValidationError("User must connect bank account")
    
    return True
```

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 (Current): Auto-Approved Bank, Admin-Only Workflow**
- `bankApproved`: Defaults to `True` on investment submission
- `bankApprovedBy`: "system"
- Only admin approval required to activate investment
- Infrastructure in place for dual approval
- Simplifies development and testing

**Phase 2 (Future): True Dual Approval with Banking Integration**
- Change default: `bankApproved = False`
- Integrate with banking API (Plaid, Stripe Treasury, etc.)
- System automatically detects incoming transfers
- Match transfer to pending investment by amount/reference
- Auto-set `bankApproved: true` when funds received
- `bankApprovedBy`: "system"
- Admin still required for final approval
- Full dual approval security in place

```python
# Future implementation
def handle_bank_webhook(webhook_data):
    """
    Handle incoming webhook from banking provider.
    Auto-approve bank when funds received.
    """
    if webhook_data['type'] == 'transfer.received':
        amount = webhook_data['amount']
        reference = webhook_data['reference']  # Should contain investment ID
        
        # Find matching pending investment
        investment = find_pending_investment_by_reference(reference, amount)
        
        if investment:
            approve_bank(investment.id, admin_id="system")
            
            # Notify admin
            send_notification_to_admin(
                f"Investment {investment.id} bank auto-approved. Please review."
            )
```

### Testing Dual Approval System

**Test Scenario 1: Current Phase (Admin-Only Approval)**
```
1. User submits investment ‚Üí status: pending
2. ‚úì Bank auto-approved ‚Üí bankApproved: true, bankApprovedBy: "system"
3. Admin approves investment ‚Üí adminApproved: true
4. ‚úì System immediately activates ‚Üí status: active, confirmedAt set
5. ‚úì Interest starts accruing next day
```

**Test Scenario 2: Future Phase (True Dual Approval)**
```
1. User submits investment ‚Üí status: pending, bankApproved: false
2. Banking API detects funds ‚Üí bankApproved: true, status still pending
3. Admin approves investment ‚Üí adminApproved: true
4. ‚úì System auto-activates ‚Üí status: active
5. ‚úì Interest starts accruing next day
```

**Test Scenario 3: Monthly Payout Approval**
```
1. System generates monthly payouts ‚Üí status: pending_approval
2. Admin reviews payout queue
3. Admin approves individual payout ‚Üí status: approved
4. ‚úì System sends to bank ‚Üí status: completed
```

**Test Scenario 4: Batch Payout Approval**
```
1. System generates 15 payouts for November
2. Admin selects all 15 payouts
3. Admin clicks "Approve All"
4. ‚úì All 15 move to approved status
5. ‚úì Background worker processes all bank transfers
```

**Test Scenario 5: Failed Payout Retry**
```
1. Payout approved and sent to bank
2. Bank transfer fails ‚Üí status: failed
3. Admin views failed payouts
4. Admin clicks retry ‚Üí retryCount++
5. ‚úì Payout reprocessed
```

## ID Architecture

### Overview

The platform uses a **sequential, human-readable ID system** for all entities. This provides:
- **Easy tracking** - IDs are meaningful and sequential
- **Debugging** - Simple to identify entity types and relationships
- **Audit trails** - Clear history of when entities were created
- **No collisions** - Sequential generation prevents duplicate IDs

### ID Format Standards

All IDs follow the pattern: `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}[-{SUFFIX}]`

| Entity Type | Format | Starting ID | Example | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **User** | `USR-{sequential}` | `USR-1000` | `USR-1001`, `USR-1002` | Admin is always `USR-1000` |
| **Investment** | `INV-{sequential}` | `INV-10000` | `INV-10001`, `INV-10002` | Global across all users |
| **Withdrawal** | `WDL-{sequential}` | `WDL-10000` | `WDL-10001`, `WDL-10002` | Global across all users |
| **Bank Account** | `BANK-{userId}-{seq}` | `BANK-USR-1000-1` | `BANK-USR-1001-2` | Per-user sequential |
| **Activity Event** | `TX-{type}-{numericId}-{TYPE}` | Various | See below | **All uppercase** composite format |

### Activity Event ID Patterns

Activity event IDs (previously called "transactions") follow the pattern: `TX-{entityType}-{numericId}-{TYPE}[-{SUFFIX}]`

**Format Rules:**
- All event IDs use **ALL UPPERCASE** format
- Entity type prefix (USR, INV, WDL) is **NOT duplicated** in the numeric ID portion
- Event types and suffixes are **UPPERCASE**

| Event Type | ID Pattern | Example |
|-----------------|------------|---------|
| Account Created | `TX-USR-{numericId}-ACCOUNT-CREATED` | `TX-USR-1001-ACCOUNT-CREATED` |
| Investment Created | `TX-INV-{numericId}-CREATED` | `TX-INV-10000-CREATED` |
| Investment Confirmed | `TX-INV-{numericId}-CONFIRMED` | `TX-INV-10000-CONFIRMED` |
| Monthly Distribution | `TX-INV-{numericId}-MD-{YYYY-MM}` | `TX-INV-10000-MD-2025-11` |
| Monthly Compounded | `TX-INV-{numericId}-MC-{YYYY-MM}` | `TX-INV-10000-MC-2025-11` |
| Withdrawal Notice | `TX-WDL-{numericId}-NOTICE` | `TX-WDL-10000-NOTICE` |
| Withdrawal Approved | `TX-WDL-{numericId}-APPROVED` | `TX-WDL-10000-APPROVED` |
| Withdrawal Rejected | `TX-WDL-{numericId}-REJECTED` | `TX-WDL-10000-REJECTED` |

**IMPORTANT - Activity Event ID Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **Use ALL UPPERCASE** for entire ID (e.g., `TX-INV-10000-CREATED`)
- ‚úÖ **Strip entity prefix** from numeric portion (e.g., `TX-USR-1001`, NOT `TX-USR-USR-1001`)
- ‚úÖ **Create exactly ONE event per occurrence** (no duplicates)
- ‚úÖ **Include only the numeric ID** without the prefix (e.g., use `1001` from `USR-1001`)
- ‚ùå **Never use lowercase** letters in event IDs
- ‚ùå **Never duplicate the entity prefix** (e.g., avoid `TX-INV-INV-10000`)
- ‚ùå **Never create duplicate events** for the same occurrence

### ID Generation Rules

#### User IDs
```python
def generate_user_id(existing_users):
    """
    Generate next sequential user ID.
    Admin always gets USR-1000.
    """
    if not existing_users:
        return "USR-1000"
    
    max_id = max([extract_numeric_id(user.id) for user in existing_users])
    next_id = max_id + 1
    return f"USR-{next_id}"

# Example progression:
# USR-1000 (admin)
# USR-1001 (first regular user)
# USR-1002 (second regular user)
```

#### Investment IDs
```python
def generate_investment_id(all_users):
    """
    Generate next sequential investment ID.
    Investment IDs are global across ALL users.
    """
    all_investments = []
    for user in all_users:
        all_investments.extend(user.investments)
    
    if not all_investments:
        return "INV-10000"
    
    max_id = max([extract_numeric_id(inv.id) for inv in all_investments])
    next_id = max_id + 1
    return f"INV-{next_id}"

# Example progression:

### Extracting Numeric IDs

```python
def extract_numeric_id(id_string):
    """
    Extract numeric portion from an ID.
    
    Examples:
    - "USR-1000" ‚Üí 1000
    - "INV-10000" ‚Üí 10000
    - "BANK-USR-1001-2" ‚Üí 2 (last number)
    """
    import re
    match = re.search(r'-(\d+)(?:-|$)', id_string)
    return int(match.group(1)) if match else 0

def extract_sequence_number(bank_id):
    """
    Extract sequence number from bank account ID.
    
    Example:
    - "BANK-USR-1001-2" ‚Üí 2
    """
    parts = bank_id.split('-')
    return int(parts[-1])
```

### ID Validation

```python
def validate_user_id(id_string):
    """Validate user ID format"""
    import re
    return bool(re.match(r'^USR-\d+$', id_string))

def validate_investment_id(id_string):
    """Validate investment ID format"""
    import re
    return bool(re.match(r'^INV-\d+$', id_string))

def validate_withdrawal_id(id_string):
    """Validate withdrawal ID format"""
    import re
    return bool(re.match(r'^WDL-\d+$', id_string))

def validate_bank_id(id_string):
    """Validate bank account ID format"""
    import re
    return bool(re.match(r'^BANK-USR-\d+-\d+$', id_string))

def validate_transaction_id(id_string):
    """Validate transaction ID format"""
    import re
    return bool(re.match(r'^TX-[A-Z]+-[A-Z]+-\d+-.+$', id_string))
```

### Special IDs

#### Admin User
The admin user **always** has ID `USR-1000`. This is the first user in the system.

```python
ADMIN_USER_ID = "USR-1000"

def is_admin(user_id):
    return user_id == ADMIN_USER_ID
```

### Database Considerations

**Indexes:**
```sql
-- User lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON users(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

-- Investment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_investment_id ON investments(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_investment_user_id ON investments(user_id);

-- Withdrawal queries
CREATE INDEX idx_withdrawal_id ON withdrawals(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_withdrawal_user_id ON withdrawals(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_withdrawal_investment_id ON withdrawals(investment_id);

-- Transaction queries
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_id ON transactions(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_user_id ON transactions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_investment_id ON transactions(investment_id);
```

**ID Storage:**
- Store IDs as `VARCHAR(50)` or `TEXT` (not as integers)
- Always include the prefix in the database
- Never strip prefixes for storage efficiency

### Best Practices

1. **Never reuse IDs** - Even if a user/investment is deleted, never reuse their ID
2. **Always validate** - Validate ID format before processing requests
3. **Log ID generation** - Log when new IDs are generated for audit trails
4. **Use constants** - Define ID prefixes as constants, not hardcoded strings
5. **Atomic generation** - Ensure ID generation is atomic to prevent duplicates
6. **Global sequences** - Investment and withdrawal IDs are global (not per-user)
7. **Human-readable** - IDs should be easy to read in logs and debugging

### Reference Implementation

See `/lib/idGenerator.js` for the complete implementation with:
- Sequential ID generation for all entity types
- Validation functions
- Helper utilities for extracting numeric portions
- Transaction ID generation for all types

## Investment Rules

### 1. Investment Amounts
- **Minimum:** $1,000
- **Increment:** Must be divisible by $10
- **Bonds:** 1 bond = $10 (e.g., $10,000 = 1,000 bonds)

### 2. Lockup Periods & Rates
- **1-year:** 8% APY
- **3-year:** 10% APY

### 3. Payment Frequencies
- **Monthly:** Interest paid out each month
- **Compounding:** Interest added to principal monthly

### 4. Account Types
- **Individual** - Single person investment account
- **Joint** - Shared account with joint holder information
- **Entity** - Business entity (LLC, Corporation, Trust, etc.)
- **IRA** - Individual Retirement Account (Traditional or Roth)

### 5. Account Type Locking

**Overview:** Once a user submits an investment for approval, their account becomes locked to that specific account type. This prevents mixing different account types under the same user account.

**Locking Rules:**

1. **Account locks when:**
   - Investment transitions to `pending` status (submitted for approval)
   - Investment is approved and transitions to `active` status
   - The user's `accountType` field is set to match the investment's account type

2. **Account unlocks when:**
   - Investment is rejected AND there are no other pending/active investments
   - Draft investment is deleted AND there are no other pending/active investments
   - When unlocking, the following fields are cleared:
     - `accountType` ‚Üí `null`
     - `jointHolder` ‚Üí `null`
     - `jointHoldingType` ‚Üí `null`
     - `entity` ‚Üí `null`

3. **Account remains locked when:**
   - User has at least one pending OR active investment
   - Even if one investment is rejected, if another is still pending/active, the account stays locked

**Implementation:**

```python
def update_investment_status(user_id, investment_id, new_status, admin_user_id=None):
    """
    Update investment status and manage account type locking.
    """
    user = get_user(user_id)
    investment = get_investment(user, investment_id)
    
    # Update investment status

    investment.updated_at = get_current_app_time()

        # Lock account type if not already set
        if not user.account_type:

    # Handle rejection (potential unlocking)

        investment.rejected_by_admin_id = admin_user_id

        user.joint_holding_type = None
        user.entity = None
    
    save_user(user)
    return {"success": True}
```

**UI/UX Implications:**

1. **Profile View:**
   - Only show account-type-specific sections (Joint Holder, Entity) when account is locked to that type
   - Check: `user.account_type == 'joint'` OR has pending/active joint investments
   - Don't show sections based on rejected/draft investments

2. **Investment Flow:**
   - If account is locked, only allow selecting the locked account type
   - Display locked type as read-only/disabled in account type selector
   - Show helpful message: "Your account is locked to [Type] investments"

3. **Account Freedom:**
   - Users with no pending/active investments can freely choose any account type
   - After rejection, user can immediately create a different account type investment

**Validation Rules:**

```python
def validate_investment_account_type(user, investment_data):
    """
    Validate that investment account type matches user's locked type (if any).
    """
    if user.account_type and investment_data['account_type'] != user.account_type:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Account type must be {user.account_type} for this user."
        )
    
    return True
```

## Interest Calculations

### üéØ Critical Principle: Every Day Counts

**Core Rule:** Interest accrues for **every single day** that Robert Ventures holds investor funds. No exceptions.

**Implementation:** We use a **hybrid calculation approach**:
1. **Partial months** (start/end) ‚Üí Daily prorated calculation
2. **Full months** (middle period) ‚Üí Monthly calculation
3. **Withdrawal** ‚Üí Daily prorated for final partial month

This ensures investors earn interest for every day while simplifying calculations for full months.

---

### The Three Calculation Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Investment Start (Partial Month)
When an investment is approved mid-month, calculate interest **daily** for the remaining days until month end.

**Example:** Investment confirmed Jan 15
```python
# Interest starts accruing Jan 16 (day after confirmation)
# Calculate for partial month: Jan 16-31

principal = 10000
annual_rate = 0.08  # 8% for 1-year
monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12  # 0.00667
days_in_month = 31
days_accrued = 16  # Jan 16-31 (inclusive)

# Prorated calculation for partial month
interest = principal * monthly_rate * (days_accrued / days_in_month)
# = 10000 * 0.00667 * (16/31) = $34.45

# This $34.45 is paid on Feb 1 (for monthly payout)
# or added to balance on Feb 1 (for compounding)
```

#### Scenario 2: Full Months (Middle Period)
After the first partial month, calculate interest on a **monthly basis** (not daily) for efficiency.

**Example:** Full months (Feb 1 onwards)
```python
# Feb 1: Calculate interest for February (full month)
monthly_interest = principal * monthly_rate
# = 10000 * 0.00667 = $66.67

# March 1: Calculate interest for March (full month)
monthly_interest = principal * monthly_rate
# = 10000 * 0.00667 = $66.67

# And so on for each full month...
```

**Why monthly calculation is safe:**
- Full calendar month = investor held funds for all days
- Monthly rate already represents average daily accrual
- Simplifies calculations without losing accuracy

#### Scenario 3: Withdrawal (Partial Final Month)
When investor requests withdrawal, calculate interest **daily** for the partial month up to withdrawal date.

**Example:** Withdrawal requested/processed Mar 20
```python
# Investment was active Mar 1-20
# Calculate interest for 20 days of March

current_balance = 10000  # or current value if compounding
annual_rate = 0.08
monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
days_in_march = 31
days_accrued = 20  # Mar 1-20

# Prorated calculation for partial month
final_month_interest = current_balance * monthly_rate * (days_accrued / days_in_march)
# = 10000 * 0.00667 * (20/31) = $43.01

# Add this to total payout
total_payout = current_balance + final_month_interest
```

### For Monthly Payout Investments

**Calculation Rules:**

```python
def calculate_monthly_payout(investment, target_date):
    """
    Calculate monthly payout for a specific month.
    
    Rules:
    1. First month after confirmation ‚Üí Prorated (partial month)
    2. Regular months ‚Üí Full monthly calculation
    3. Withdrawal month ‚Üí Prorated (partial month)
    """
    principal = investment.amount
    annual_rate = 0.08 if investment.lockup_period == '1-year' else 0.10
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
    
    confirmed_date = investment.confirmed_at.date()
    interest_start_date = confirmed_date + timedelta(days=1)
    
    # Determine if this is first month, regular month, or withdrawal month
    
    # FIRST MONTH (Partial)
    if target_date.month == interest_start_date.month and target_date.year == interest_start_date.year:
        days_in_month = monthrange(target_date.year, target_date.month)[1]
        # Count days from interest_start_date to end of month
        days_accrued = (date(target_date.year, target_date.month, days_in_month) - interest_start_date).days + 1

        interest = principal * monthly_rate
        return round(interest, 2)
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ Interest starts **day after confirmation**
- ‚úÖ First month is **prorated by days**
- ‚úÖ Full months use **simple monthly rate**
- ‚úÖ Withdrawal month is **prorated by days**
- ‚úÖ Principal **never changes** (for monthly payout)

    interest_start_date = confirmed_date + timedelta(days=1)
    
    current_balance = principal
    current_date = date(interest_start_date.year, interest_start_date.month, 1)
    
    # Move to first day of next month (when first interest payment happens)

        'current_value': round(current_balance, 2),
        'total_earnings': round(current_balance - principal, 2)
    }
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ First partial month: **Daily prorated**
- ‚úÖ Full months: **Compound monthly** (interest added to principal)
- ‚úÖ Final partial month (withdrawal): **Daily prorated**
- ‚úÖ Balance **grows with each compounding**

### Withdrawal Final Payment Calculation

**Critical:** When processing a withdrawal, calculate interest for the partial final month.

```python
def calculate_final_withdrawal_amount(investment, withdrawal_date):
    """
    Calculate total amount to pay investor on withdrawal.
    Must include prorated interest for partial final month.
    """
    if investment.payment_frequency == 'monthly':
        # Monthly payout: Return principal + prorated interest for final month
        principal = investment.amount
        annual_rate = 0.08 if investment.lockup_period == '1-year' else 0.10
        monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
        
        # Calculate days in current month until withdrawal
        days_in_month = monthrange(withdrawal_date.year, withdrawal_date.month)[1]
        days_accrued = withdrawal_date.day
        
        # Prorated interest for partial final month
        final_month_interest = principal * monthly_rate * (days_accrued / days_in_month)
        
        total_payout = principal + final_month_interest
        return round(total_payout, 2)
    
    else:  # compounding
        # Compounding: Calculate current value including final partial month
        calc = calculate_compounding_value(investment, withdrawal_date)
        return calc['current_value']
```

---

### Why This Hybrid Approach?

**Benefits:**
1. ‚úÖ **Fair to investors** - Every day earns interest
2. ‚úÖ **Accurate** - No days are lost or double-counted
3. ‚úÖ **Efficient** - Full months use simple monthly calculation
4. ‚úÖ **Clear** - Easy to explain to investors
5. ‚úÖ **Auditable** - Clean monthly boundaries for accounting

**Example: Why monthly calc is safe for full months:**
```
Daily calculation for full month:
- Jan has 31 days
- Daily rate: 8% / 365 = 0.0219% per day
- 31 days: (1.000219)^31 - 1 ‚âà 0.68%

Monthly calculation:
- Monthly rate: 8% / 12 = 0.667%

Difference is negligible, and monthly is standard practice.
```

**When you MUST use daily prorated:**
- ‚úÖ First partial month after confirmation
- ‚úÖ Last partial month before withdrawal
- ‚úÖ Any month where investment wasn't active for all days

---

## Pending Payouts System

### Problem
Monthly payouts can fail if:
- Bank account disconnected
- User changed password
- Bank misconfigured

### Solution
Store failed payouts in a **pending queue** instead of losing them.

### Implementation

**When generating monthly payouts:**
```python
def create_monthly_payout(user, investment, amount, date):
    # Check bank connection status
    bank_connected = check_bank_connection(user, investment)
    
    if bank_connected:
        status = 'completed'
        send_to_bank(user.bank_account, amount)
    else:
        status = 'pending'
        failure_reason = 'Bank account connection lost'
    
    # Store transaction
    transaction = {
        'type': 'monthly_distribution',
        'amount': amount,
        'date': date,
        'status': status,
        'failure_reason': failure_reason if not bank_connected else None,
        'retry_count': 0
    }
    
    save_transaction(transaction)
```

**Admin can:**
- View all pending payouts
- Retry sending payout
- Manually mark as completed
- Mark as failed with reason

---

## Withdrawal Rules

### Lockup Period
- Investment is **locked** during lockup period
- Cannot request withdrawal until lockup expires
- User can only initiate withdrawal for **active** investments after lockup ends

### Processing Timeline
- **Robert Ventures has 90 days** from withdrawal request to process and complete payout
- This is a **business deadline**, not a user waiting period
- Admin can process withdrawal at any time within the 90-day window
- Countdown starts immediately when user requests withdrawal

### Withdrawal Business Logic
When a user requests withdrawal:
1. Investment status changes from `active` to `withdrawal_notice`
2. A `payoutDueBy` date is set to `withdrawal_requested_at + 90 days`
3. Investment continues to earn interest during this period (if compounding)
4. Admin can process withdrawal anytime before `payoutDueBy`
5. Once processed, investment status becomes `withdrawn` (final state)

**Calculation:**
```python
# When user requests withdrawal (only allowed if lockup ended)
payout_due_by = withdrawal_requested_at + 90 days

# Store in withdrawal record
withdrawal = {
    "requestedAt": withdrawal_requested_at,
    "payoutDueBy": payout_due_by,
    "status": "notice"
}

# Update investment
investment.status = "withdrawal_notice"
investment.payoutDueBy = payout_due_by
```

**Example 1: Normal case**
```
Confirmed: Jan 1, 2024
Lockup: 1 year ‚Üí ends Jan 1, 2025
Withdrawal requested: Mar 1, 2025 (lockup already ended ‚úì)
Payout due by: May 30, 2025 (90 days later)

Timeline:
- Mar 1, 2025: User requests withdrawal
- Mar 1 - May 30: Robert Ventures processes payout
- Admin can approve anytime in this window
- Investment still visible to user throughout and after
```

**Example 2: Cannot withdraw before lockup**
```
Confirmed: Jan 1, 2024
Lockup: 3 years ‚Üí ends Jan 1, 2027
Withdrawal requested: Oct 1, 2025

Result: ‚ùå REJECTED - Lockup period not yet ended
User must wait until Jan 1, 2027 to request withdrawal
```

**Example 3: Compounding investment**
```
Confirmed: Jan 1, 2024
Amount: $10,000
Lockup: 1 year at 8% APY compounding
Withdrawal requested: Feb 1, 2025 (13 months later)
Current value: $10,869.60

Payout due by: May 2, 2025
Interest continues accruing Feb 1 - payout date
Final payout includes all accrued interest up to payment date
```

### Amount Withdrawn

**Monthly payout investments:**
- Withdraw **principal only** ($10,000)
- Interest already paid out monthly

**Compounding investments:**
- Withdraw **full current value** (principal + accrued interest)

### Total Earnings After Withdrawal

**IMPORTANT:** When calculating portfolio metrics (dashboard summary), **Total Earnings** represents **lifetime earnings** across all investments, including withdrawn ones.

**Calculation Rules:**
- **Withdrawn investments:** Include their stored `totalEarnings` value (captured at withdrawal time)
- **Active/withdrawal_notice investments:** Calculate current earnings dynamically
- **Total Invested:** Only includes active and withdrawal_notice investments (NOT withdrawn)
- **Current Value:** Only includes active and withdrawal_notice investments (NOT withdrawn)

**Example:**
```
User has 3 investments:
1. Active compounding: $10,000 ‚Üí current value $10,800 (earnings: $800)
2. Withdrawn compounding: was $5,000 ‚Üí withdrawn at $5,330 (earnings: $330)
3. Active monthly: $8,000 ‚Üí paid $480 in distributions so far (earnings: $480)

Dashboard metrics:
- Total Invested: $18,000 (only investments 1 and 3)
- Current Value: $18,800 (only investments 1 and 3)
- Total Earnings: $1,610 (ALL investments: $800 + $330 + $480)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Users want to see their lifetime performance, not just current holdings
- If a user earned $5,000 and withdrew it, that's still $5,000 earned
- Total Earnings should never decrease when a withdrawal completes
- The chart of earnings over time should continue to show historical earnings from withdrawn investments

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_total_earnings(investments, transactions, app_time):
    """
    Calculate lifetime earnings including withdrawn investments.
    """
    total = 0.0
    
    for inv in investments:
        if inv.status == 'withdrawn':
            # Use stored final earnings from withdrawal
            total += inv.totalEarnings or 0
        elif inv.status in ['active', 'withdrawal_notice']:
            # Calculate current earnings dynamically
            if inv.paymentFrequency == 'monthly':
                # Sum paid distributions
                paid = sum(
                    tx.amount for tx in transactions
                    if tx.type == 'monthly_distribution' 
                    and tx.investmentId == inv.id
                    and tx.date <= app_time
                )
                total += paid
            else:  # compounding
                # Calculate accrued earnings
                calc = calculate_investment_value(inv, app_time)
                total += calc.totalEarnings
    
    return round(total, 2)
```

## Data Models

### Important Schema Changes

**Recent updates to the data model (October 2025):**

1. **`activity` replaces `transactions`**
   - User object now has `activity` array instead of `transactions`
   - This better reflects that the array contains all account activity, not just financial transactions
   - All API responses and database queries should use `activity` field
   - Frontend components updated to reference `user.activity` instead of `user.transactions`

2. **`acknowledgements` field removed from User**
   - The `acknowledgements` field at the user level has been removed
   - Acknowledgements are tracked per-investment in the `documents.consent` section
   - This is captured during the investment finalization step, not at the user level

3. **`anticipatedEarnings` NOT stored in Investment**
   - The `anticipatedEarnings` field is **calculated dynamically**, not stored
   - Frontend calculates this value on-the-fly based on:
     - Investment amount
     - Lockup period (1-year = 8% APY, 3-year = 10% APY)
     - Payment frequency (monthly vs compounding)
   - Backend should **never** store this value in the database
   - Example calculation in `InvestmentReviewForm.js` shows proper implementation

4. **Account Types reduced to 4**
   - Only four valid account types: `individual`, `joint`, `entity`, `ira`
   - Removed: `custodial`, `roth-ira`, `traditional-ira`
   - IRA subtype (traditional/roth) is stored in the investment's `iraType` field

```

**Key Fields Explained:**

- **`bankApproved`** - True when bank confirms funds received. Required before admin can approve.
- **`adminApproved`** - True when admin manually approves investment. Required before activation.
- **`confirmedAt`** - When BOTH approvals complete and investment became `active`. Interest starts accruing from day after.
- **`lockupEndDate`** - Calculated as `confirmedAt + lockup_period`. User cannot withdraw before this date.
- **`payoutDueBy`** - Deadline for Robert Ventures to complete payout. Set to `withdrawalNoticeStartAt + 90 days`.
- **`finalValue`** - Total amount withdrawn (principal + all accrued interest). Only set when status = `withdrawn`.
- **`withdrawnAt`** - When admin processed withdrawal and funds were paid out. Becomes final state.

**Important Notes:**
- **`anticipatedEarnings` is NOT stored** - This value is calculated dynamically based on amount, lockup period, and payment frequency. Do not include this field in the database schema.
- **`accountType` values** - Only four types are valid: `individual`, `joint`, `entity`, `ira`. The `ira` type can have subtypes (traditional/roth) stored in `iraType` field.

### Activity Entry (formerly Transaction)

**Note:** Activity entries are stored in the user's `activity` array (not `transactions`). Each entry represents a significant event in the user's investment journey.

```json
{
  "id": "TX-INV-10000-MD-2025-11",  // Format: TX-{entityType}-{numericId}-{TYPE} (all uppercase)
  "userId": "USR-1001",  // Optional - usually inferred from context
  "investmentId": "INV-10000",  // Present for investment/withdrawal events, absent for account_created
  "type": "account_created|investment_created|investment_confirmed|investment_rejected|monthly_distribution|monthly_compounded|withdrawal_requested|withdrawal_notice_started|withdrawal_approved|withdrawal_rejected",
  "amount": 66.67,  // Present for monetary events, ABSENT for account_created
  "date": "2025-10-05T00:00:00.000Z",  // ISO8601 format

  // For monthly distributions only:
  "payoutStatus": "pending_approval|approved|completed|failed",
  "approvedBy": "string or null",  // Admin user ID who approved
  "approvedAt": "ISO8601 or null",
  "failureReason": "string or null",
  "retryCount": 0,
  "payoutBankId": "BANK-USR-1001-1",
  "payoutBankNickname": "Primary Account",
  "monthIndex": 1
}
```

**Important Activity Event Field Rules:**
- `id`: Always uppercase format (e.g., `TX-INV-10000-CREATED`)
- `amount`: Only present for monetary events (investment_created, investment_confirmed, investment_rejected, monthly_distribution, monthly_compounded, withdrawals). **NOT present for account_created**.
- `investmentId`: Present for investment and withdrawal events, absent for account_created
- `payoutStatus`, `approvedBy`, `approvedAt`, `failureReason`, etc.: Only present for monthly_distribution events
- **New:** `payoutStatus` includes `pending_approval` state for admin approval workflow

### Withdrawal
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "investmentId": "string",
  "amount": 10000,
  "principalAmount": 10000,
  "earningsAmount": 0,
  "status": "notice|approved|rejected",
  "requestedAt": "ISO8601",
  "noticeStartAt": "ISO8601",
  "payoutDueBy": "ISO8601",
  "approvedAt": "ISO8601 or null",
  "paidAt": "ISO8601 or null"
}

## Business Logic Implementation

### 0. User Account Creation

When a new user signs up, the system must create exactly **one** account creation transaction:

```python
def create_user(email, password):
    """
    Create new user account with initial activity event.
    CRITICAL: Only create ONE account_created event.
    """
    timestamp = get_current_time()
    user_id = generate_user_id()  # e.g., "USR-1001"
    
    # Generate activity event ID using the standard function
    # This will produce: TX-USR-1001-ACCOUNT-CREATED
    event_id = generate_activity_event_id('USR', user_id, 'account_created')
    
    user = {
        'id': user_id,
        'email': email.lower().strip(),
        'password': hash_password(password),

        'updated_at': timestamp,
        'is_verified': False,
        'investments': [],
        'activity': [
            {

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ‚úÖ **ONE event per occurrence** - Never create duplicate events
- ‚úÖ **ALL UPPERCASE format** - Event IDs must be entirely uppercase (e.g., `TX-USR-1001-ACCOUNT-CREATED`)
- ‚úÖ **Standard format** - Follow pattern: `TX-{entityType}-{numericId}-{TYPE}`
- ‚úÖ **No amount field** - Account creation events don't have monetary values
- ‚úÖ **Idempotency** - If user creation is retried, check for existing user first
- ‚ùå **NO lowercase** - Never use `tx-` (lowercase) for transaction IDs
- ‚ùå **NO duplicates** - Each event should create exactly one transaction

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Creates duplicate activity entries
user.activity = [
    {'id': 'TX-USR-USR-1001-account-created', ...},  # Correct format
    {'id': 'tx-USR-1001-account-created', ...}       # Duplicate with wrong format
]

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Single activity entry with proper format
user.activity = [
    {'id': 'TX-USR-USR-1001-account-created', ...}   # One entry
]
```

### 1. User Creates Draft
```python
investment = {
    'status': 'draft',
    'created_at': get_current_time(),
    'amount': 10000,
    'payment_frequency': 'monthly',
    'lockup_period': '1-year'
}
```

### 2. User Submits for Approval
```python
def submit_investment(investment):
    """
    Submit investment for approval.
    Bank approval is auto-set to true until banking integration is ready.
    """
    investment.status = 'pending'
    investment.submitted_at = get_current_time()
    
    # Phase 1: Auto-approve bank (no banking integration yet)
    investment.bank_approved = True
    investment.bank_approved_at = get_current_time()
    investment.bank_approved_by = "system"
    
    # Phase 2: When banking integration is ready, set to False
    # investment.bank_approved = False
    # investment.bank_approved_at = None
    # investment.bank_approved_by = None
    
    investment.admin_approved = False
    investment.admin_approved_at = None
    investment.admin_approved_by = None
    
    save_investment(investment)

### 3a. Bank Approval (Optional - For Phase 2)
```python
def approve_bank(investment_id, admin_id):
    """
    Mark investment as bank approved (funds received).
    
    NOTE: This endpoint is optional in Phase 1 since bankApproved defaults to True.
    Will be used in Phase 2 when banking integration is implemented.

    # Check if both approvals complete ‚Üí auto-activate
    if investment.bank_approved and investment.admin_approved:
        activate_investment(investment)
```

### 3b. Admin Approval (Primary Approval in Phase 1)
```python
def approve_admin(investment_id, admin_id):
    """
    Admin approves investment after reviewing details.
    
    Phase 1: Since bankApproved defaults to True, this will immediately activate.
    Phase 2: Will check for bank approval before activating.
    """
    investment = get_investment(investment_id)
    
    if investment.status != 'pending':
        raise ValidationError("Only pending investments can be admin approved")

    #     raise ValidationError("Bank approval required before admin approval")
    
    investment.admin_approved = True

    investment.admin_approved_by = admin_id
    
    save_investment(investment)

    # In Phase 1, bank is always approved, so this will activate immediately
    if investment.bank_approved and investment.admin_approved:
        activate_investment(investment)
```

### 3c. Auto-Activation (When Both Approvals Complete)
```python
def activate_investment(investment):
    """
    Activate investment when both approvals are complete.
    """
    investment.status = 'active'
    investment.confirmed_at = get_current_time()
    
    # Calculate lockup end date
    if investment.lockup_period == '1-year':
        investment.lockup_end_date = investment.confirmed_at + timedelta(days=365)
    else:  # 3-year
        investment.lockup_end_date = investment.confirmed_at + timedelta(days=1095)
    
    # Create confirmation activity event
    create_activity_event(
        user_id=investment.user_id,
        investment_id=investment.id,
        type='investment_confirmed',
        amount=investment.amount,
        date=investment.confirmed_at
    )
    
    save_investment(investment)
    
    # Interest starts accruing from the day AFTER confirmation
    interest_start_date = investment.confirmed_at + timedelta(days=1)
```

### 4. Admin Rejects Investment
```python
investment.status = 'rejected'
investment.rejected_at = get_current_time()
investment.rejection_reason = 'Insufficient documentation'
```

### 5. User Requests Withdrawal
```python
if investment.status != 'active':
    raise Error('Only active investments can be withdrawn')

investment.status = 'withdrawal_notice'
investment.withdrawal_requested_at = get_current_time()

# 90-day notice period
notice_end = withdrawal_requested_at + timedelta(days=90)
investment.withdrawal_notice_end_at = notice_end

# Payout on the later of: notice end or lockup end
investment.withdrawal_eligible_at = max(notice_end, investment.lockup_end_date)
```

### 6. Admin Processes Withdrawal
```python
if get_current_time() < investment.withdrawal_eligible_at:
    raise Error('Withdrawal not yet eligible for payout')

investment.status = 'withdrawn'
investment.withdrawn_at = get_current_time()
investment.final_value = calculate_withdrawal_amount(investment)

# Send funds to user's bank account
process_withdrawal_payout(user, investment.final_value)
```

### 7. Monthly Event Generation (Cron Job)
Should run daily to check if new month started:

```python
def generate_monthly_events():
    current_time = get_current_time()
    
    for user in get_all_users():
        for investment in user.investments:
            # Only generate events for active investments and those in withdrawal notice
            if investment.status not in ['active', 'withdrawal_notice']:
                continue
            
            if investment.payment_frequency == 'monthly':
                generate_monthly_payout(user, investment, current_time)
            else:
                generate_compounding_event(investment, current_time)
```

**Note:** Investments in `withdrawal_notice` status continue earning interest during the 90-day notice period.

### 8. Withdrawal Request Creation
```python
def create_withdrawal(user_id, investment_id):
    investment = get_investment(user_id, investment_id)
    
    # Only active investments can be withdrawn
    if investment.status != 'active':
        raise Error('Only active investments can be withdrawn')
    
    current_time = get_current_time()
    notice_end = current_time + timedelta(days=90)
    lockup_end = investment.lockup_end_date
    
    # Payout on the later date
    payout_eligible = max(notice_end, lockup_end)
    
    # Create withdrawal record
    withdrawal = {
        'id': generate_id(),
        'investment_id': investment_id,
        'user_id': user_id,
        'status': 'notice',  # notice ‚Üí approved ‚Üí completed
        'requested_at': current_time,
        'notice_end_at': notice_end,
        'payout_eligible_at': payout_eligible,
        'amount': calculate_withdrawal_amount(investment)
    }
    
    # Update investment status
    investment.status = 'withdrawal_notice'
    investment.withdrawal_requested_at = current_time
    investment.withdrawal_notice_end_at = notice_end
    investment.withdrawal_eligible_at = payout_eligible
    
    save_withdrawal(withdrawal)
    save_investment(investment)
    
    return withdrawal
```

## Validation Rules

### Email
- Must be valid email format
- Must be unique in system
- Normalized to lowercase before storage
- Verification required before investing (but not for sign-in)

### Password
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain: uppercase letter, number, special character
- Hashed before storage (never store plaintext)
- Reset tokens expire after 1 hour

### SSN
- Format: XXX-XX-XXXX
- Required for tax reporting

### Investment Amount
- Minimum: $1,000
- Must be divisible by $10

### Date of Birth
- Must be 18+ years old

### Investment Status Transitions
- **CRITICAL:** Active investments (`status = 'active'`) cannot be rejected
- Once an investment is active, it can only transition to `withdrawal_notice` or remain `active`
- This rule must be enforced in both API validation and UI (disabled reject button)
- Attempting to reject an active investment should return HTTP 400 with error: "Cannot reject an active investment"

### Dual Approval Requirements

**Phase 1 (Current - Development):**
- Bank approval **auto-set to true** on investment submission
- Only admin approval required to activate
- Simplifies testing and development workflow
- Infrastructure ready for Phase 2

**Phase 2 (Future - Production with Banking):**
- Bank approval required before activation
- Admin approval required before activation
- Investment automatically activates when BOTH approvals complete
- Order doesn't matter: bank‚Üíadmin or admin‚Üíbank (system handles both)
- Each approval action is logged with timestamp and approver ID

### Monthly Payout Approvals
- All monthly payouts (`paymentFrequency: 'monthly'`) start as `pending_approval`
- Admin must approve before payout is sent to bank
- Batch approval supported for efficiency
- Failed payouts can be retried manually
- Approval history logged for audit trail

### Trusted Contact (Optional)
- All fields are optional
- Email must be valid format if provided
- Phone must be valid US 10-digit format if provided
- Relationship must be one of: spouse, parent, sibling, child, friend, attorney, financial_advisor, other

## Database Indexes

For performance, create these indexes:

```sql
-- Investment status queries
CREATE INDEX idx_investment_status ON investments(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_investment_user_status ON investments(user_id, status);

-- Withdrawal eligible investments
CREATE INDEX idx_investment_withdrawal_eligible 
  ON investments(withdrawal_eligible_at) 
  WHERE status = 'withdrawal_notice';

-- Active investments for monthly events
CREATE INDEX idx_investment_confirmed 
  ON investments(confirmed_at) 
  WHERE status IN ('active', 'withdrawal_notice');

-- User lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

-- Activity queries
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_user ON activity(user_id, date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_investment ON activity(investment_id, date DESC);
```

### Common Queries

**Get all investments needing monthly payout:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM investments 
WHERE status IN ('active', 'withdrawal_notice')
AND payment_frequency = 'monthly'
AND confirmed_at IS NOT NULL
```

**Get withdrawals ready to process:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM investments
WHERE status = 'withdrawal_notice'
AND withdrawal_eligible_at <= CURRENT_DATE
```

**Get pending investments for admin:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM investments
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY submitted_at ASC
```

---

## Admin Time Machine

For testing and demos, admin can set a custom "app time" that affects:
- Investment calculations
- Monthly payout generation
- Lockup period checks
- Withdrawal eligibility

**Storage:**
```json
{
  "timeMachine": {
    "appTime": "2026-03-15T00:00:00.000Z",
    "isActive": true,
    "setBy": "admin-user-id",
    "setAt": "2025-10-02T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
```python
def get_current_time():
    if time_machine.is_active:
        return time_machine.app_time
    else:
        return datetime.now()
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### Session Timeout & Auto-Logout

**Security Feature:** Protect user accounts by automatically logging out inactive users.

**Requirements:**
- **Timeout Duration:** 10 minutes of inactivity
- **Warning Dialog:** Show warning 1 minute before auto-logout
- **User-Friendly Messaging:** Clear communication about session expiry
- **Activity Tracking:** Monitor mouse, keyboard, touch, and scroll events
- **Applies To:** All authenticated users (investors and admins)

**User Experience Flow:**
1. User logs in and starts session
2. Session timer tracks inactivity (10 minutes)
3. At 9 minutes: Warning dialog appears
   - Message: "Your session will expire in 1 minute due to inactivity. Click OK to stay logged in."
   - Options: OK (reset timer) or dismiss (logout in 1 minute)
4. At 10 minutes: Automatic logout
   - Clear all session data
   - Redirect to sign-in page with message
5. Sign-in page shows: "Your session has expired due to inactivity. Please sign in again."

**Activity Events That Reset Timer:**
- Mouse movement
- Mouse clicks
- Keyboard input
- Touch events (mobile)
- Scroll events
- Any interaction with UI elements

**Implementation Details:**
See the **Authentication & Verification** section ‚Üí **Session Timeout & Inactivity** for complete implementation guide with code examples.

### Investment Visibility Rules

**Dashboard Investment List:**
Investors should see ALL their investments with these statuses:
- `active` - Currently earning interest
- `withdrawal_notice` - Withdrawal in progress
- `withdrawn` - Completed withdrawals (for historical record)

**Excluded from dashboard:**
- `draft` - Unsubmitted (shown only in creation flow)
- `pending` - Awaiting admin approval (shown in separate pending section)
- `rejected` - Admin rejected (can be shown in a separate section)

### Investment Value Display Labels

Context-aware labels based on investment status:

| Status | Label to Display | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| `active` | "Current Value" | Live investment value with accrued interest |
| `withdrawal_notice` | "Current Value" | Value including interest during processing |
| `withdrawn` | "Final Withdrawal Value" | The total amount that was paid out |

### Withdrawal Request Flow

**Requirements:**
1. **Only active investments** after lockup can request withdrawal
2. **Confirmation modal** (not alert) must show:
   - Principal amount
   - Total earnings
   - Total withdrawal amount
   - Clear message: "Robert Ventures has 90 days to process your payout"
   - Warning: "This action cannot be undone"
3. **After confirmation:**
   - Investment status ‚Üí `withdrawal_notice`
   - Investment remains visible
   - Withdrawal tab is hidden (already requested)
   - Show withdrawal status in Investment Info tab

### Activity/Transaction Display

**Transaction Types and Labels:**
- `monthly_distribution` ‚Üí "Monthly Payout"
- `monthly_compounded` ‚Üí "Monthly Compounded"
- `withdrawal_notice_started` ‚Üí "Withdrawal Notice Started"
- `withdrawal_approved` ‚Üí "Withdrawal Processed" (not "Approved")
- `withdrawal_rejected` ‚Üí "Withdrawal Rejected"

**Activity Filtering:**
- Investment details page: Show only activity for that specific investment
- Dashboard activity page: Show all activity across all investments

### Status Badges

Investment status should display user-friendly labels:
- `active` + lockup ended ‚Üí "Available for Withdrawal"
- `active` + locked ‚Üí "Locked"
- `withdrawal_notice` ‚Üí "Withdrawal Processing"
- `withdrawn` ‚Üí "Withdrawn"
- `pending` ‚Üí "Pending Approval"
- `rejected` ‚Üí "Rejected"

### Portfolio Totals Calculation

**When calculating portfolio summary (total value, earnings, etc.):**

Include in totals:
- `active` investments - Full current value
- `withdrawal_notice` investments - Full current value (still active until paid)

Exclude from totals:
- `withdrawn` investments - Money already returned to user
- `pending` investments - Show separately as "pending"
- `draft` investments - Not yet submitted
- `rejected` investments - Never active

**Example:**
```python
# Portfolio calculation
total_current_value = 0
total_earnings = 0

for investment in user.investments:
    if investment.status in ['active', 'withdrawal_notice']:
        calculation = calculate_value(investment, app_time)
        total_current_value += calculation.current_value
        total_earnings += calculation.total_earnings
    # withdrawn investments are visible but not in totals

return {
    "totalCurrentValue": total_current_value,
    "totalEarnings": total_earnings,
    "investments": all_visible_investments  # includes withdrawn
}
```

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

Your backend implementation should be validated against these core scenarios:

#### 1. **Authentication & User Management**
- User sign-up creates account with `isVerified: false`
- Unverified users can sign in but redirected to verification
- Verification code `000000` marks account as verified
- Password reset automatically verifies account
- Admin users bypass verification check

#### 2. **Investment Lifecycle**
Test all investment states and transitions:
- `draft` ‚Üí Create and edit investment
- `pending` ‚Üí Submit for approval (bank auto-approved, admin required)
- `active` ‚Üí Dual approval activates investment
- `withdrawal_notice` ‚Üí User requests withdrawal after lockup
- `withdrawn` ‚Üí Admin processes withdrawal (includes final partial month)
- `rejected` ‚Üí Admin rejects pending investment

#### 3. **Account Type Combinations**
Test all valid account type + payment frequency + lockup combinations:
- **Individual:** All combinations valid (8 total)
- **Joint:** All combinations valid (8 total)
- **Entity:** All combinations valid (8 total)
- **IRA:** Only compounding valid (2 total: 1-year, 3-year compounding)

**Invalid combinations to reject:**
- IRA + Monthly payout (must be compounding)

#### 4. **Interest Calculations**
Verify penny-perfect accuracy for:
- **First partial month:** Daily prorated (e.g., 16/31 days)
- **Full months:** Monthly rate calculation
- **Current partial month:** Included in real-time display
- **Final partial month:** Included in withdrawal payout

**Example to verify:**
```
Investment: $10,000 at 8% APY
Confirmed: Jan 15, 2025
Withdrawal: Mar 20, 2025

Expected:
- Jan 16-31: $34.41
- Feb 1-28: $66.67
- Mar 1-20: $43.01
- Total: $144.09
```

#### 5. **Monthly Event Generation**
- Events generated only for completed months
- First month prorated based on confirmation date
- Monthly distributions require admin approval before payout
- Compounding events compound interest into principal
- Failed payouts queued with `pending` status

#### 6. **Withdrawal Processing**
- Only active investments after lockup can withdraw
- Withdrawal request starts 90-day processing window
- Investment continues earning interest during withdrawal notice
- Final payout includes partial month interest
- `finalValue` and `totalEarnings` stored on completion

#### 7. **Account Type Locking**
- Account locks when investment reaches `pending` status
- User cannot create different account type while locked
- Account unlocks only when no pending/active investments exist
- Rejected investments allow immediate account type change

#### 8. **Dual Approval System**
- Bank approval defaults to `true` (Phase 1)
- Admin approval required for activation
- Investment auto-activates when both approvals complete
- `confirmedAt` set when both approvals present

#### 9. **App Time System**
- All calculations use app time (not system time)
- Admin can set custom date for testing
- Time travel affects all calculations
- Monthly events respect app time

#### 10. **Edge Cases & Validation**
- Minimum investment: $1,000
- Amount must be divisible by $10
- Age must be 18+
- Email must be unique and valid
- SSN format validation
- Cannot reject active investments
- Cannot withdraw before lockup ends

### Test Data Requirements

Create test investments covering:
- Both payment frequencies (monthly, compounding)
- Both lockup periods (1-year, 3-year)
- All four account types
- Various confirmation dates (mid-month, start of month, end of month)
- Withdrawals at different points in the lifecycle

### Validation Criteria

Your implementation is correct when:
1. ‚úÖ All calculations match reference to the penny
2. ‚úÖ State transitions follow rules exactly
3. ‚úÖ Every day earns interest (including partial months)
4. ‚úÖ Dual approval workflow functions properly
5. ‚úÖ Monthly events generate correctly with proration
6. ‚úÖ Withdrawals include final partial month interest
7. ‚úÖ Account type locking prevents mixing types
8. ‚úÖ App time affects all date-based logic
9. ‚úÖ API responses match expected JSON structure
10. ‚úÖ All validation rules enforced consistently

```

#### Three Calculation Scenarios

**1. First Partial Month (after confirmation)**
```python
# Example: Confirmed Jan 15, interest starts Jan 16
interest = principal * (annual_rate / 12) * (days_accrued / days_in_month)
# = 10000 * 0.08/12 * (16/31) = $34.41
```

**2. Full Months (middle period)**
```python
# Simple monthly calculation (not daily)
interest = principal * (annual_rate / 12)
# = 10000 * 0.08/12 = $66.67
```

**3. Last Partial Month (at withdrawal)**
```python
# Example: Withdrawn on Jun 15 (15 days into June)
interest = principal * (annual_rate / 12) * (days_accrued / days_in_month)
# = 10000 * 0.08/12 * (15/30) = $33.33
```

#### Complete Example: 64-Day Investment

| Period | Type | Calculation | Interest |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| Jan 16-31 | Partial | 10000 √ó 0.00667 √ó (16/31) | $34.41 |
| Feb 1-28 | Full | 10000 √ó 0.00667 | $66.67 |
| Mar 1-20 | Partial | 10000 √ó 0.00667 √ó (20/31) | $43.01 |
| **Total** | **64 days** | | **$144.09** |

#### Key Rules
- ‚úÖ Interest starts **day after** `confirmedAt`
- ‚úÖ **Partial months** (start/withdrawal) ‚Üí Daily prorated
- ‚úÖ **Full months** ‚Üí Monthly calculation for efficiency
- ‚úÖ Withdrawal always includes final partial month interest
- ‚úÖ Every single day must earn interest

---

### üè¶ Dual Approval System

**Phase 1 (Current - Development):**
```python
investment.bankApproved = True      # Auto-approved by system
investment.adminApproved = False    # Requires admin action

# When admin approves ‚Üí investment activates immediately
```

**Phase 2 (Future - Banking Integration):**
```python
investment.bankApproved = False     # Requires banking API confirmation
investment.adminApproved = False    # Requires admin action

# Investment activates when BOTH are true (order doesn't matter)
```

**Payout Approval:**
- Monthly payouts default to `pending_approval` status
- Admin must approve each payout before it's sent to bank
- Batch approval supported for efficiency

---

### üî¢ ID Formats

| Entity | Format | Example | Starting ID |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| User | `USR-{seq}` | `USR-1001` | `USR-1000` (admin) |
| Investment | `INV-{seq}` | `INV-10001` | `INV-10000` |
| Withdrawal | `WDL-{seq}` | `WDL-10001` | `WDL-10000` |
| Bank Account | `BANK-{userId}-{seq}` | `BANK-USR-1001-2` | `BANK-{userId}-1` |
| Activity Event | `TX-{type}-{numericId}-{TYPE}` | `TX-INV-10000-CREATED` | Varies by type |

**Activity Event Patterns:**
- `TX-USR-1001-ACCOUNT-CREATED` (account creation)
- `TX-INV-10000-CREATED` (investment created)
- `TX-INV-10000-CONFIRMED` (investment confirmed)
- `TX-INV-10000-MD-2025-11` (monthly distribution, November 2025)
- `TX-INV-10000-MC-2025-11` (monthly compounded, November 2025)
- `TX-WDL-10000-NOTICE` (withdrawal notice)
- `TX-WDL-10000-APPROVED` (withdrawal approved)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** 
- All activity event IDs must be **ALL UPPERCASE**
- Never duplicate entity prefix (e.g., avoid `TX-INV-INV-10000`)
- Create exactly ONE event per occurrence

---

### üìÖ Withdrawal Timeline

```
User Request ‚Üí Robert Ventures has 90 days to process
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Investment status: withdrawal_notice
‚îú‚îÄ Still earning interest (if compounding)
‚îú‚îÄ payoutDueBy = request_date + 90 days
‚îî‚îÄ Admin can process anytime within window
   ‚îÇ
   ‚ñº
Withdrawal Processed ‚Üí Investment status: withdrawn (FINAL)
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚è∞ 90 days is Robert Ventures' **processing deadline** (not user waiting period)
- üí∞ Investment continues earning interest during this period
- üîí User can only withdraw after lockup period ends
- üìä Withdrawn investments remain visible for historical records

---

### üìä Critical Data Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose | Set When |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| `confirmedAt` | ISO8601 | Interest start calculation | Both approvals complete |
| `lockupEndDate` | ISO8601 | Earliest withdrawal date | Investment activated |
| `payoutDueBy` | ISO8601 | RV processing deadline | Withdrawal requested |
| `finalValue` | Number | Total payout amount | Withdrawal completed |
| `totalEarnings` | Number | Lifetime earnings | Withdrawal completed |
| `bankApproved` | Boolean | Bank confirmation | Auto-set (Phase 1) |
| `adminApproved` | Boolean | Admin confirmation | Admin action |

---

### üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Modify JSON field names or structure
- Use lowercase in activity event IDs
- Create duplicate activity events
- Allow rejection of active investments
- Auto-send monthly payouts without approval
- Use real time instead of app time
- Delete withdrawn investments from database
- Store `anticipatedEarnings` in database (calculate dynamically)

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Match calculations to the penny
- Follow state transition rules strictly
- Generate activity events in UPPERCASE
- Preserve withdrawn investments for history
- Use app time for all calculations
- Validate all state transitions
- Log all approval actions for audit trail

---

---

### üìö Quick Reference Links

**Code References:**
- `/app/api/` - Next.js API routes (reference implementation)
- `/lib/investmentCalculations.js` - Interest calculation logic
- `/lib/idGenerator.js` - ID generation functions
- `/lib/database.js` - Data access patterns
- `/lib/appTime.js` - App time system

**Test Scenarios:**
Write tests to validate:
- All 26 valid account type combinations (4 types √ó 2 frequencies √ó 2 lockups, minus 6 invalid IRA+monthly)
- Time-based calculations with various confirmation dates
- Edge cases: minimum amounts, invalid enums, age validation
- Payout approval system with pending/completed/failed states
- Account type locking behavior across all states

**Data Examples:**
- `/data/users.json` - Sample user data structure

---

### üîê Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage:** Use bcrypt with at least 10 rounds
2. **Email Enumeration:** Always return success on password reset (don't reveal if email exists)
3. **Token Expiry:** Reset tokens expire after 1 hour
4. **Session Timeout:** Auto-logout after 10 minutes of inactivity (see Authentication & Verification section)
5. **Admin Permissions:** Verify admin status on all protected endpoints
6. **Audit Logging:** Log all approval actions with admin ID and timestamp
7. **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs (amounts, dates, status transitions)

---

### üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with authentication** - Get user management solid first
2. **Test calculations obsessively** - Use time machine to verify edge cases
3. **Follow the state machine** - Never allow invalid transitions
4. **Check reference implementation** - When stuck, look at `/app/api/` routes
5. **Use provided ID generators** - Don't reinvent ID generation logic
6. **Preserve all data** - Never delete withdrawn investments or activity events
7. **App time everywhere** - Always use `get_current_app_time()` for consistency

---

### üìû Getting Help

**When stuck:**
1. Check this guide's relevant section
2. Review reference implementation in `/app/api/`
3. Write tests based on scenarios in Testing section
