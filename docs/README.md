# Backend Documentation

**Single source of truth for backend developers**

## ðŸ“„ BACKEND-GUIDE.md

This is the **only document** you need to implement the backend.

### What's Inside

âœ… **Investment States** - Complete lifecycle from draft to withdrawn  
âœ… **Business Rules** - All validation and calculation logic  
âœ… **Interest Calculations** - Prorated monthly calculations with examples  
âœ… **Pending Payouts** - Failed payment queue system  
âœ… **Withdrawal Logic** - 90-day notice + lockup period rules  
âœ… **Data Models** - Complete JSON schemas for all entities  
âœ… **API Endpoints** - All required endpoints  
âœ… **Code Examples** - Python implementation examples  
âœ… **Database Indexes** - Performance optimization queries  
âœ… **Testing Guide** - How to validate your implementation  

### Quick Start

1. Read **BACKEND-GUIDE.md** from top to bottom
2. Implement the 6 investment states exactly as defined
3. Use the code examples as your reference
4. Match the API endpoint structure precisely
5. Test against the existing Next.js implementation

### Key Points

- Frontend expects **exact JSON structure** from data models
- Investment states are: `draft`, `pending`, `active`, `withdrawal_notice`, `withdrawn`, `rejected`
- Interest calculations must be **daily-prorated** for partial months
- All dates/times must use **app time** (not real time) for testing support
- Calculations must match **to the penny**
