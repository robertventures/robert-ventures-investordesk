  - BACKEND-GUIDE.md is now the single source of truth for all technical documentation
  - Removed redundant documentation files to prevent confusion and duplication:
    - ‚ùå `AUDIT-REPORT.md` - Security audit details now in BACKEND-GUIDE
    - ‚ùå `FORMATTING-REFACTOR-SUMMARY.md` - Formatting utilities documented in BACKEND-GUIDE
    - ‚ùå `docs/CSRF-MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md` - CSRF security details in BACKEND-GUIDE
    - ‚ùå `docs/CSRF-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Security practices in BACKEND-GUIDE
    - ‚ùå `docs/CSRF-TEST-REPORT.md` - Testing requirements in BACKEND-GUIDE
  - Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive history of Oct 21-22 work
  - All development, security, API, and system documentation centralized
  - Improved maintainability with single documentation file to update

- **Benefits of consolidation**:
  - ‚úÖ No duplicate or conflicting information

  - ZIP code formatting (5 digits)
  - Date handling that preserves exact dates without timezone shifting

- **Enhanced import API endpoint** (`/api/admin/import-investors`):
  - Creates Supabase Auth users with default password (`Test1234!`)
  - Auto-verifies imported accounts (admin-created)
  - Creates complete database user records with all account-type-specific fields
  - Creates primary address records in `addresses` table

  - Password reset and verification flows updated for Supabase
  - Service role key for admin operations, anon key for client operations

  - ‚úÖ Real-time capabilities with Supabase subscriptions
  - ‚úÖ Proper ACID transactions
  - ‚úÖ Better query performance with PostgreSQL
  - ‚úÖ Row Level Security for data protection

  - ‚úÖ Development server running without errors

#### üêõ **CRITICAL BUG FIX** - Investment submission staying in draft status (Morning)

  - Added `lastModified` timestamp to track data freshness
  - Implemented read-after-write verification in `saveUsers()` with automatic retry on stale data
  - Added `?fresh=true` API parameter for extended retry logic (10 retries √ó 800ms)

  - System now detects stale data and automatically retries until fresh data is available
- **Note**: This fix was made obsolete by evening Supabase migration, which eliminates consistency issues entirely

#### üé® **UI/UX Improvements**
- Fixed activity feed sorting to show newest items first (was showing oldest first)
