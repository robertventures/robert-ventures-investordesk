# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document tracks all files and folders removed during the cleanup process to maintain a lean, maintainable codebase.

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Changes:** Removed unused pages, one-time migration routes, and orphaned CSS modules

---

## üóëÔ∏è Removed Files and Folders

### 1. Unused Pages
- **`app/notifications/`** (folder + all contents)
  - **Reason:** Not referenced anywhere in the app. No navigation links to this page.
  - **Impact:** None - was a duplicate/unused feature

- **`app/activity/`** (folder + all contents)  
  - **Reason:** Redundant with `/dashboard?section=activity` route which handles all activity views
  - **Impact:** None - functionality preserved in dashboard page

### 2. One-Time Migration Routes
These were data migration scripts that ran once during system upgrades and are no longer needed:

- **`app/api/migrate-investments/`** (folder + route.js)
  - **Purpose:** Migrated old 'pending' investments to 'active' status based on confirmedAt dates
  - **Reason:** One-time migration completed
  - **Impact:** Removed unused API call from `PortfolioSummary.js`

- **`app/api/migrate-account-types/`** (folder + route.js)
  - **Purpose:** Moved account types from investment level to user level
  - **Reason:** One-time migration completed
  - **Impact:** None - not called anywhere

- **`app/api/migrate-confirmed-status/`** (folder + route.js)
  - **Purpose:** Renamed investment status from 'confirmed' to 'active'
  - **Reason:** One-time migration completed
  - **Impact:** None - not called anywhere

### 3. Orphaned CSS Modules
These CSS files had no corresponding JavaScript components:

- **`app/components/InvestmentBankingForm.module.css`**
- **`app/components/InvestmentPersonalInfoForm.module.css`**
- **`app/components/InvestmentResidentialAddressForm.module.css`**
- **`app/components/InvestmentTypeSelect.module.css`**
- **`app/components/SignupForm.module.css`**

**Reason:** These CSS modules existed without any JavaScript components using them  
**Impact:** None - not imported or referenced anywhere

### 4. Temporary Files
- **`app/admin/page-refactored.js`** 
  - **Reason:** Temporary file created during refactoring, already merged into main page.js

## ‚úÖ Kept (Active and Required)

### Active Migration Route
- **`app/api/migrate-transactions/`** ‚úì
  - **Purpose:** Generates transaction/activity events dynamically
  - **Status:** ACTIVELY USED - Called by `TransactionsList` and `PortfolioSummary` on every load
  - **Function:** Backfills activity events for investments (distributions, compounding, etc.)

### Active CSS Modules
- **`app/components/TabbedSignup.module.css`** ‚úì
  - **Status:** Used by `app/investment/page.js` (imported as `stepStyles`)

All other CSS modules have corresponding JavaScript components.

## üîç How to Verify

To verify nothing was accidentally removed, check:

```bash
# Test the app locally
npm run dev

# Navigate through all pages:
# - Dashboard (all sections: portfolio, profile, documents, activity, contact)
# - Investment flow
# - Admin panel (all tabs)
# - Sign in/out

# Check for console errors or missing imports
```

## üìù Notes

- All cleanup was done conservatively - only removed files that were **confirmed unused**
- Active migration route (`migrate-transactions`) was kept as it's essential for generating activity events
- No breaking changes were introduced
- All existing functionality remains intact
