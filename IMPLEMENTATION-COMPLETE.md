2. üîÑ Test in development environment
3. üîÑ Deploy to production
4. üîÑ Train admin users on bulk upload process

### Testing Recommendations

**Admin Side:**
- [ ] Upload sample ZIP with 3-5 PDFs
- [ ] Test duplicate name scenario
- [ ] Test no-match scenario
- [ ] Upload to single user
- [ ] Delete document
- [ ] Delete all for a year

**User Side:**
- [ ] Login as test user
- [ ] View Documents page
- [ ] Download tax document
- [ ] Verify email received

**Error Cases:**
- [ ] Upload non-PDF (should reject)
- [ ] Upload duplicate year (should reject)
- [ ] Invalid ZIP file (should error gracefully)
- [ ] User tries wrong document (should deny)

## File Naming Convention

**For Bulk Upload:**

‚úÖ **Correct Format:**
```
JosephRobert_7273_2.pdf
JohnSmith_1234.pdf
MaryJohnson_9999_tax.pdf
```

‚ùå **Incorrect Format:**
```
Joseph_Robert.pdf          (underscore between names)
joseph-robert.pdf          (lowercase, hyphen)
JR_tax_2024.pdf           (initials only)
tax_form_joseph.pdf       (name not at start)
```

**Pattern:** `FirstnameLastname_anything.pdf`
- First name: starts at beginning, all letters
- Last name: immediately after first name, all letters  
- Underscore: required after last name
- Anything after underscore: ignored
